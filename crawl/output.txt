Muy bien preparado y estructurado

Tengo conocimientos sobre estos temas y es uno de los cursos mejor estructurados y preparados que he visto. Me ha servido para profundizar más. Buen ritmo de lectura y con ejemplos prácticos.

Great quality presentation for beginner-intermediate HTML/CSS users

I really enjoyed this short course on creating responsive HTML emails because it hit all the necessary points without going into too much detail about rudimentary HTML and CSS. The fact that it's such a short course makes it so that you can go back and treat the entire series as a quick-reference case study if you're just learning HTML and CSS. I recently completed a few HTML and CSS courses through Udemy and that's as much as I know about markup so this course is perfect because it allows me to test the new skills I learned. I plan to go back and review the semantics and styles that Chris used. Like I mentioned, he doesn't go into every little detail about why he added this much padding here or that much margin there, so it engages the student to have to review the course materials and think critically about the instructor's design choices. This in turn will help any user create their own designs and implementation. If there was anything I would change, I suggest a bonus lecture on how to place a link that would open up the email in a web browser in case the end user can't render the full design. Should that link to a web page or a pdf file, etc.? But other than that, I say take this course, I highly recommend it. Happy coding!

It's simply a Ctrl + C / Ctrl V course

This course was really frustrating because you could tell the instructor knew about the subject and the videos were well produced but there was no teaching! It might be a good course for a PRO. A person who is already a Professional HTML Email developer. For someone who wants to learn the ropes it is far from good.

Beyond Worth the Money!

I've done a few other responsive email tutorials that give you a complicated and unreliable way of doing things. This way makes so much sense and Chris shows that he's tested it extensively. I also like how he is thorough without being too wordy. His instructions are clear and concise. He's sharing a wealth of information that I'm quite grateful for. Especially, putting videos in email. I'm very happy I paid for this course.

Absolutely brilliant!

This course did a great job showing me the limitations of e-mail design, and how to still get the best results from your e-mail marketing. Everything was explained very well, with lots of visuals to really get the most important points across. And I have to say that the video and audio quality were excellent as well (which isn't always the case in other Udemy courses). Great job!
