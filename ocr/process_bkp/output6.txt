■ Sampling from given distribution                  
                                                    
■    Step 1: Get sample u from uniform              
distribution over [0,1)                             
• f .g. random() <n python                          
■    Step 2: Convert this sample u into an          
outcome for the given distribution by               
having each outcome associated with                 
a sub-interval of (0,1) with sub-interval           
size equal to probability of the                    
outcome
