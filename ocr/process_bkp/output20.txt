                                       Sampling Example                             
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
■ There are 2 cups.                                                                 
■    The first contains 1 penny and 1 quarter                                       
■    The second contains 2 quarters                                                 
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
 Say I pick a cup uniformly at random, then pick a coin randomly from that          
 cup. It's a quarter (yes!). What is the probability that the other coin in that    
 cup is also a quarter?
