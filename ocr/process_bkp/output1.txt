■    A directed, acyclic graph, one node per random variable        
■    A conditional probability table (CPT) for each node            
■ A collection of distributions over X, one for each combination    
of parents' values

■ Bayes' nets implicitly encode joint distributions                 
■    As a product of local conditional distributions                
■    To see what probability a BN gives to a full assignment,       
multiply all the relevant conditionals together:
